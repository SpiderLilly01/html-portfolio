<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am from Edenvale in Johannesburg. I moved down to stellenbosch to try and find a better life for me here.
  After searching and searching i finally have found something to do and a place to live. There was alot to consider
  and sort out.
</p>

<p>I am now trying the coding thing to see how it goes and how it works. There is alot to do and alot to get used to but 
  eventually there will be a time where this all seems natural and easy to do. i do know that this will take alot of time to 
  get used to but with doing it everyday and pushing through there will be a time where this all come naturally.
